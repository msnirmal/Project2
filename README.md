## **UX**
---
### **Strategy**

To be in line with UX principles, first i thought  of a strategy to identify who the target users would be and what features they are looking for 

Animal quiz target users are:
* Aged 15 & over (Can be under 15's with parental permission to use electronics)
* Animal lovers 
* People who have passion for nature and its creation  

User requirements:
* Website that's simple and meets the purpose
* Ease of navigation  
* Basic content for the understanding of kids under 15
* To be able to view on all devices 

### **Scope**

* Title header which is self explanatory and navigation links to access various sections of the page 
* Stunning Images of animals in their natural habitat
* Submit button that doesn't allow you click more than once to basically test your knowledge
* Next button to sail through the various questions with ease 
* Reload button to relaunch the quiz once complete, to try again 
* Simple and easy to understand text that states the score out of total questions 
* Interactive result text, which pops whether correct or incorrect  

### **Structure**

This is a single page website that includes quiz area, inside which there's quiz images, input text box, submit button, next button and reload button, sections to show score and result. 

### **Skeletal**

While creating a draft for this website and during the building process, i used different background colors, however, i felt the images that i have used will contrast well with a white background for quiz area and rest of body has yellow to contrast with the neon blue buttons. Also, i have used font Vollkorn for header and Poppins for the text content in quiz area with default browser font for button 

### **Surface**

The overall background of this website is Yellow with white background for quiz area, keeping in mind the colors of the images and the button colors i have used 

## **Features**
---

### *User Stories*

1. **As a first-time visitor, I want an interactive quiz site that is simple and easy to use**

   The page is made simple keeping in mind users of all age group. As soon as a user launches the page, they can see the quiz area prompting them to guess the animal 

2. **As a first-time visitor, I want to easily navigate through the various questions involved in the quiz**

   The User can easily click the next button to move to next image at their convenience as they are not timed 

3. **As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to test my knowledge on animals and i want to know when the quiz has ended and what my total score is out of the total no. of questions**

   The users have a considerable amount of quiz images to take a tour of the animal world and once the quiz has ended, there's a message that prompts them that they are done and what their final score is

4. **As a first-time visitor, i want the quiz to be self explanatory, rather than having to go through multiple paragraphs of instructions and buttons leading to various other pages and finding my way back**

    The website is designed as simple, so that a school going kid can easily understand, what is expected off them to play the quiz. There's no need to go through multiple pages and several paragraph of instructions 

5. **As a first time, i want the quiz to prompt if i am correct or incorrect**

   I have incuded a section that increments the score for all correct answers as a user traverses through the quiz 

6. **As a first time visitor, i want to be able to easily reload the quiz when it has ended or i want to intentionaly pause and launch from the beginning**

   To the bottom left hand corner of the website i have included reload button with an icon to relaunch the quiz 

   While testing i came across a few bugs as mentioned below- 

   1. **Entering correct answer and clicking the submit button more than once was incrementing the score**

       I have added code to my javascript function to disable the submit button after the first click

   2. **if answer is blank and the user clicks submit validation needs to be done**

       I have added a code to my functions with a comment to let the user know, they have entered a value 

   3. I have come across some responsive issues and working to fix that

   ### **HTML and CSS Validation**
   ---

   I have validated both HTML and CSS codes and no errors found

   ### **Javascript code quality check on JSHint**

   Note: The unused variables are called in the HTML file and i am aware of the issue and it is in fact resolved.
